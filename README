A simple Qt-based 2D game engine.

========
1. Build
========

1.1) Dependencies

* Qt5
  	Qt5 source repository: https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

1.2) Building

Available QMake parameters:

* QTPATH (Optional)
	Prefix where Qt has been installed. It is required to install
	Bacon2D's QML import plugin and related files.
	The default path is /usr/lib/qt5

* BUILD_EXAMPLES (Optional)
	Use BUILD_EXAMPLES=1 to build usage examples.

Sample build from Bacon2D's root source tree:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ qmake QTPATH=/opt/Qt5 BOX2DPATH=/usr BUILD_EXAMPLES=1 ..
$ make
$ sudo make install


===========
2. Examples
===========

If you have installed the QML plugin to the proper Qt import directory,
you can run the examples directly from their specific build directories.

Example:

$ cd $(QUASI_BUILD_TREE)/examples/box2ddistancejoints/
$ ./box2ddistancejoints

If Bacon2D QML plugin was not installed you need first to export QML2_IMPORT_PATH
environment variable:

$ export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=$(QUASI_BUILD_TREE)/src/imports
