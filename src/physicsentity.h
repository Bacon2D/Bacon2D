         \li A kinematic body moves under simulation according to its velocity. Kinematic bodies do not respond to
             forces. They can be moved manually by the user, but normally a kinematic body is moved by setting its
             velocity. A kinematic body behaves as if it has infinite mass, however, Box2D stores zero for the mass
             and the inverse mass. Kinematic bodies do not collide with other kinematic or static bodies.

             non-zero mass. If you try to set the mass of a dynamic body to zero, it will automatically acquire a mass
             of one kilogram and it wonâ€™t rotate.

      \qmlproperty bool PhysicsEntity::bullet
      \brief Game simulation usually generates a sequence of images that are played at some frame rate. This is
       called discrete simulation. In discrete simulation, rigid bodies can move by a large amount in one
       time step. If a physics engine doesn't account for the large motion, you may see some objects incorrectly pass
       through each other. This effect is called tunneling.

       By default, Box2D uses continuous collision detection (CCD) to prevent dynamic bodies from tunneling
       through static bodies. This is done by sweeping shapes from their old position to their new positions.
       The engine looks for new collisions during the sweep and computes the time of impact (TOI) for these
       collisions. Bodies are moved to their first TOI and then the solver performs a sub-step to complete the
       full time step. There may be additional TOI events within a sub-step.

       Normally CCD is not used between dynamic bodies. This is done to keep performance reasonable. In
       some game scenarios you need dynamic bodies to use CCD. For example, you may want to shoot a high
       speed bullet at a stack of dynamic bricks. Without CCD, the bullet might tunnel through the bricks.
       Fast moving objects in Box2D can be labeled as bullets. Bullets will perform CCD with both static and
       dynamic bodies. You should decide what bodies should be bullets based on your game design.

      \brief What does sleep mean? Well it is expensive to simulate bodies, so the less we have to simulate the
       better. When a body comes to rest we would like to stop simulating it.

       When Box2D determines that a body (or group of bodies) has come to rest, the body enters a sleep
       state which has very little CPU overhead. If a body is awake and collides with a sleeping body, then the
       sleeping body wakes up. Bodies will also wake up if a joint or contact attached to them is destroyed. You
       can also wake a body manually.

       The sleepingAllowed property lets you specify whether a body can sleep and whether a body is created sleeping.
